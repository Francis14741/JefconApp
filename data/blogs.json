The effects of these extreme changes have brought more flooding in our Cities, especially Asaba, Warri, Effurun, and Environs since they lie within the Niger Delta region of Southern Nigeria. Despite these extreme weather changes from global warming, less attention is being given to the management, and control of stormwater by the government. The excess stormwater leads to the loss of agricultural farmlands, contamination of groundwater and rivers, and loss of lives and property of immeasurable values. Today, due to the global climate change, Asaba, Warri, Effurun, and its environs are experiencing more months and frequent rainfall rather than the old known pattern of six months dry and six months rainy seasons.  The effect on these cities and environs has defied the efficacy of existing drainage systems put in place by government and corporate bodies over the years.  Hence, there was an urgent need by the government of Delta State to study and construct sustainable drainage systems for the management and control of Stormwater in Asaba, Warri, Effurun, and Environs. This desire led to the Engineering Study and Design conducted in Asaba, Warri, Effurun, and Environs.  Using interviews of locals, participatory meetings, and engineering surveys more in-depth knowledge of the flooding and causes was gathered. The study looked at how overland drainages can be incorporated into nature-based gifts, such as Valleys, Waterways, and Rivers for the safe evacuation of the excess runoff generated from the environment. Results obtained showed that improving the efficiency of these Natural Watercourses and Rivers would bring better management and control of the outfalls of both existing and new drainages into these Natural Watercourses. For this to be successful, the inhabitants must be aware of the environmental hazards associated with blocking of Valleys and Waterways with structures and dumping of waste materials into Storm Sewers and Drains, which would create blockages for the efficient evacuation of the Stormwater generated from the Environment...",

However, because we are in a dynamic world with lots of complexity occurring daily, the codes of practice have also become revolutionised with many countries coming out with their codes of practice to suit the dynamics of their environment. For this reason, the <strong>British Standard (BS) code</strong> is now used alongside the <strong>European Standard codes (Eurocodes)</strong> in many countries, including Nigeria.  Most engineering books nowadays come in both British Standard (BS) code and European Standard codes (Eurocodes).  The use of either code in design does not invalidate the work of the designer. It is important to get familiar with recent developments by reading these volumes of codes instead of relying on the use of only familiar and simplified codes..",

It will also discourage quacks from the profession and reduce the incessant cases of infrastructural failures that are recorded almost on a yearly basis in our Country.It is encouraging to note that some States in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, like Lagos, Federal Capital Territory – Abuja, and Rivers have been implementing external review checks on Technical Documents submitted for approval.  It will be in the interest of our developing economy if other States in the Federation emulate the earlier mentioned States in this practice. This can be achieved through the recruitment of professional Engineers to manage these external review functions in the various Establishments vested with such powers. The essence of this is to ensure that set standards and recommended codes of practice are followed in the design and execution of engineering projects. Most of these practising States require in addition to the calculation sheets and drawings submitted for approval, a letter of undertaking, passport photograph, and a photocopy of the COREN certificate of the designer to accompany these design documents.

Stormwater can infiltrate the soil, be stored on the land surface in ponds and puddles, evaporate, or resolved to runoff. Most runoff is conveyed directly to nearby streams, rivers, or other water bodies (surface water) without treatment. In natural environment, such as green areas, soil absorbs much of the stormwater. Plants also reduce stormwater by improving infiltration, intercepting precipitation as it falls, and by taking up water through their roots. In developed environments, unmanaged stormwater can create two major issues: One related to the volume and timing of runoff (flooding), And the other related to potential contaminants the water is carrying (water pollution)....",

        "content":  "Studies were conducted to identify all the flood-prone areas in Asaba, Warri, Effurun, and environs, all in Delta State of Nigeria.  These studies were to help develop efficient and effective flood water control measures that would safely convey run-off from the streets to the natural watercourses and rivers without loss of lives and property. These basins were broken into catchments using existing road networks for delineation as boundaries. In the case of Asaba, the absence of water bodies limited the design approach to nature-based types, such as valleys, streams, and rivers that are tributaries to the River Niger. But in the case of Warri and Effurun, the catchment areas contain lots of water bodies (swamps) and natural watercourses, which serve as the receiving basins for floodwater evacuation from the environment..",

        "content": "Flooding is a very serious issue in Nigeria, as it can lead to significant damage to property and even loss of life. Floods can occur due to heavy seasonal rains or from overflowing bodies of water such as rivers and oceans. Flooding can be a major problem for those living in areas with low-lying land or in cities where there is poor drainage. In order to handle flooding in any area of Nigeria, there are a variety of strategies that can be implemented. This article lists 7 ways that you can handle flooding in any area of Nigeria. These strategies can be used by individuals, organizations, and governments to reduce the destruction caused by flooding and ensure the safety of those living in affected areas. Whether you are living in a rural area or a city, these strategies will help you to be better prepared for a flood and handle it in the most effective way possible. When it comes to flooding in Nigeria, prevention is key. We must work together to develop a comprehensive plan that includes early warning systems, improved nfrastructure, and risk management strategies to ensure we are better prepared to handle future floods....",

        "content":  "Climate change continues to threaten our planet, with the most immediate threat being extreme flooding. Rising tides and sinking cities have become a stark reality with devastating consequences for many communities around the world. It's a global problem that requires immediate attention and action from governments, businesses, and individuals. In recent years, increased levels of carbon dioxide emissions have led to warmer ocean temperatures and melting polar ice caps, causing sea levels to rise. The impact of these changes has been acutely felt in many coastal areas in Nigeria, as an example, causing more intense and frequent flooding. This blog post will explore the relationship between climate change and extreme flooding, and how it is affecting cities and towns across the world. We will examine the science behind rising sea levels and how it affects our coasts, as well as the social and economic impact of flooding. We will also take a closer look at the strategies and technologies being used to mitigate the effects of climate change on flooding...",
