The effects of these extreme changes have brought more flooding in our Cities, especially Asaba, Warri, Effurun, and Environs since they lie within the Niger Delta region of Southern Nigeria.<br>Despite these extreme weather changes from global warming, less attention is being given to the management, and control of stormwater by the government. The excess stormwater leads to the loss of agricultural farmlands, contamination of groundwater and rivers, and loss of lives and property of immeasurable values.<br>Today, due to the global climate change, Asaba, Warri, Effurun, and its environs are experiencing more months and frequent rainfall rather than the old known pattern of six months dry and six months rainy seasons.  The effect on these cities and environs has defied the efficacy of existing drainage systems put in place by government and corporate bodies over the years.  Hence, there was an urgent need by the government of Delta State to study and construct sustainable drainage systems for the management and control of Stormwater in Asaba, Warri, Effurun, and Environs.<br>This desire led to the Engineering Study and Design conducted in Asaba, Warri, Effurun, and Environs.  Using interviews of locals, participatory meetings, and engineering surveys more in-depth knowledge of the flooding and causes was gathered. <br>The study looked at how overland drainages can be incorporated into nature-based gifts, such as Valleys, Waterways, and Rivers for the safe evacuation of the excess runoff generated from the environment. <br>Results obtained showed that improving the efficiency of these Natural Watercourses and Rivers would bring better management and control of the outfalls of both existing and new drainages into these Natural Watercourses. For this to be successful, the inhabitants must be aware of the environmental hazards associated with blocking of Valleys and Waterways with structures and dumping of waste materials into Storm Sewers and Drains, which would create blockages for the efficient evacuation of the Stormwater generated from the Environment...",

Most engineering books nowadays come in both British Standard (BS) code and European Standard codes (Eurocodes).

It will also discourage quacks from the profession and reduce the incessant cases of infrastructural failures that are recorded almost on a yearly basis in our Country.<br>It is encouraging to note that some States in the Federal Republic of Nigeria, like Lagos, Federal Capital Territory – Abuja, and Rivers have been implementing external review checks on Technical Documents submitted for approval.  It will be in the interest of our developing economy if other States in the Federation emulate the earlier mentioned States in this practice.  <br>This can be achieved through the recruitment of professional Engineers to manage these external review functions in the various Establishments vested with such powers. The essence of this is to ensure that set standards and recommended codes of practice are followed in the design and execution of engineering projects. <br>Most of these practising States require in addition to the calculation sheets and drawings submitted for approval, a letter of undertaking, passport photograph, and a photocopy of the COREN certificate of the designer to accompany these design documents.

Stormwater can infiltrate the soil, be stored on the land surface in ponds and puddles, evaporate, or resolved to runoff. Most runoff is conveyed directly to nearby streams, rivers, or other water bodies (surface water) without treatment. In natural environment, such as green areas, soil absorbs much of the stormwater. Plants also reduce stormwater by improving infiltration, intercepting precipitation as it falls, and by taking up water through their roots. In developed environments, unmanaged stormwater can create two major issues: One related to the volume and timing of runoff (flooding), And the other related to potential contaminants the water is carrying (water pollution)....",
